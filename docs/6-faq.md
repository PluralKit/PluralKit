## Can I use this bot for kin/roleplay/other non-plurality uses? Can I use it if I'm not plural myself? Is that appropriating?
Although this bot is designed with plural systems and their use cases in mind, the bot's feature set is still useful for many other types of communities, including role-playing and otherkin. By all means go ahead and use it for those communities, too. We don't gatekeep, and neither should you.

## Who's the mascot?
[Our lovely bot mascot](https://imgur.com/a/LTqQHHL)'s name is Myriad! They were drawn by the lovely [Layl](https://twitter.com/braindemons). Yes, there are fictives.

## How can I support the bot's development?
I (the bot author, [Ske](https://twitter.com/floofstrid) have a Patreon. The income from there goes towards server hosting, domains, infrastructure, my Monster Energy addiction, et cetera. There are no benefits. There might never be any. But nevertheless, it can be found here: [https://www.patreon.com/floofstrid](https://www.patreon.com/floofstrid)

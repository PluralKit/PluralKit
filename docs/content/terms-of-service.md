# Terms of Service

This page outlines PluralKit's Terms of Service - **the rules you have to follow to use PluralKit** - in plain language. I'm not a lawyer, and having a 50-page document here filled with legal jargon means no one will read it - so we're keeping things as simple as we can.

By using PluralKit, you agree to these terms, whether you've read them or not. Please also read our [Privacy Policy](/privacy), which talks about what data PluralKit does and does not collect.

This version of the policy is effective from November 11th, 2024. Previous versions of this policy [can be viewed on GitHub](<https://github.com/PluralKit/PluralKit/commits/main/docs/content/terms-of-service.md>).

If you have any questions or concerns regarding this policy, please join [the support server](<https://discord.gg/PczBt78>) (preferred), or email [legal@pluralkit.me](mailto:legal@pluralkit.me).

## You must abide by the Discord Terms of Service, and the Discord Community Guidelines

This includes, but is not limited to:

- You must meet [the minimum age requirement to use Discord](<https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360040724612-Why-is-Discord-asking-for-my-birthday>) (which is 13 years of age in most, but not all, countries)
- Any and all forms of bullying; harassment; and/or making threats towards any person (or group of people), are prohibited
    - This includes, but is not limited to, using PluralKit to evade blocks
    - We recommend reading [Discord's Bullying, Harassment, and Threats Policy Explainer](<https://discord.com/safety/bullying-harassment-threats-policy-explainer>) for clarification
- Any and all forms of hate speech, ([as defined by Discord](<https://discord.com/safety/hateful-conduct-policy-explainer>)), are prohibited
- Impersonation of any person; group of people; or organisation, where the impersonation is deliberately deceptive or harmful, is prohibited
    - This includes, but is not limited to, using PluralKit to impersonate staff members of servers you're in; or using PluralKit to impersonate a Discord bot in a given server

## You must not use PluralKit for hosting sexually explicit content

Sexually explicit content is strictly forbidden on Discord in any spaces that are not age-restricted. As all data in PluralKit is publicly visible by default, this means you must not have any sexually explicit content associated with public PluralKit systems, members, or groups.

Using sexually explicit images as *server-specific* avatars; or having sexually explicit text in *server-specific* member display names, is permitted *only if the server in question is entirely age-restricted*. We do not allow sexually explicit images to be uploaded to the PluralKit CDN in any form - if you wish to use a sexually explicit image as a server-specific avatar, you must use an alternate image hosting provider for that content.

We recommend reading [Discord's Sexual Content Policy Explainer](<https://discord.com/safety/sexual-content-policy-explainer>) in addition to these terms.

## You are responsible for the the security of your PluralKit system

All Discord accounts that are linked to your PluralKit system; and anyone with the token for your PluralKit system, can modify (or delete) any and all data associated with your PluralKit system.

If you suffer any data loss as a result of linking a Discord account not owned by you to your system, or sharing your PluralKit system token with anyone, we can not be held responsible for that data loss.

## Actions we can take if you break these terms

If you violate these terms, any action we may take is at our discretion.

We will, generally, do the least restrictive thing needed to resolve any issues that may arise. For example, if you set sexually explicit images as your public member avatars, we may delete those images, and replace the image links of the members in question with an image containing a link to these terms (or the Discord Sexual Content Policy Explainer).

## How to report violations of these terms

If a PluralKit user is violating these terms *in the content of their proxied messages*, please report the messages to Discord directly with the in-app Report Message function - found in the right-click menu on a message on desktop; and in the press-and-hold menu on mobile. PluralKit staff can not take action on the content of a proxied message, as we do not store message content (as detailed in our [Privacy Policy](/privacy/)).

If a PluralKit user is violating these terms in ways other than message content, please contact us in [the support server](<https://discord.gg/PczBt78>), or email [abuse@pluralkit.me](mailto:abuse@pluralkit.me). Please include all relevant information (including PluralKit system/member/group IDs; Discord account usernames/IDs; etc.), so that we can investigate.

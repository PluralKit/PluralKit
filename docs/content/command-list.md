# Non-prefixed commands

Some bot commands do not use the `pk;` prefix:

- `[tag]` e.g. `S: message` - if `pk;system proxy` is on, proxy this message, based on configured member proxy tags
- `\` - if autoproxy is enabled: as a one-off exception, don't proxy this message, without changing latch/switch/autoproxy
- `\\` - if autoproxy latch is enabled: don't proxy this message, and clear latch status, without disabling autoproxy

# Commands

::: tip
You can have a space after `pk;`, e.g. `pk;system` and `pk; system` will do the same thing.

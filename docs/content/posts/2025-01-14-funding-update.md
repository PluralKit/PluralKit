## january 2025 funding update

hi @everyone! a little update from [last month's announcement](/posts/2024-12-05-downtime-notes/).

we've signed a sponsorship agreement with [Prodigi](https://prodigi.nz) -
they've agreed to let us use some of their space in a US datacenter
(specifically HE FMT2).
> Prodigi is a New Zealand based technology services provider. They offer shared
web hosting and VPSes, as well as business networking and consultancy services.

while we have datacenter space available now, we still need to buy servers to
put there. we've bought some hardware with the donations from last month (thank
you very much!), but we're looking for **$2000** more in donations. this will
allow us to get servers that will last us a very long time, and support the bot
as it gets bigger in the future.

one-time donations are best on
[buy me a coffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/pluralkit), but donations on
[patreon](https://patreon.com/pluralkit) are appreciated too. if neither of
those work for you, let us know in the
[support server](https://discord.gg/PczBt78).

alternatively, if you're a enterprise hardware manufacturer/vendor (or SFMIX,
since we'll need a port there) and would like to also sponsor us, please reach
out at <team@pluralkit.me> :â€‹)

we're hoping to get everything set up in the new datacenter and the bot moved
over towards end of february / beginning of march. we'll let you know!

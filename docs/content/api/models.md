# Models

A question mark (`?`) next to the *key name* means the key is optional - it may be omitted in API responses. A question mark next to the *key type* means the key is nullable - API responses may return `null` for that key, instead of the specified type.

In PATCH endpoints, all keys are optional. However, you must provide at least one valid key to update; please use a GET request if you want to query the existing information.
<br>Sending a PATCH request with an empty JSON object, or with a JSON object that contains no valid keys for the target entity, will result in a 400 bad request error.

Privacy objects (`privacy` key in models) contain values "private" or "public". Patching a privacy value to `null` will set to public. If you do not have access to view the privacy object of the member, the value of the `privacy` key will be null, rather than the values of individual privacy keys.

#### Notes on IDs

Every PluralKit entity has two IDs: a short (5-character) ID and a longer UUID. The short ID is unique across the resource (a member can have the same short ID as a system, for example), while the UUID is consistent for the lifetime of the entity and globally unique across the bot.

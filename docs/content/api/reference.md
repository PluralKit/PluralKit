# API Reference

PluralKit has a basic HTTP REST API for querying and modifying your system.
The root endpoint of the API is `https://api.pluralkit.me/v2/`.

#### Authorization header token example
```
Authorization: z865MC7JNhLtZuSq1NXQYVe+FgZJHBfeBCXOPYYRwH4liDCDrsd7zdOuR45mX257
```

Endpoints will always return all fields, using `null` when a value is missing. On `PATCH` endpoints,
missing fields from the JSON request will be ignored and preserved as is, but on `POST` endpoints will
be set to `null` or cleared.

For models that have them, the keys `id`, `uuid` and `created` are **not** user-settable.

Endpoints taking JSON bodies (eg. most `PATCH` and `PUT` endpoints) require the `Content-Type: application/json` header set.

## Authentication
Authentication is done with a simple "system token". You can get your system token by running `pk;token` using the
Discord bot, either in a channel with the bot or in DMs. Then, pass this token in the `Authorization` HTTP header
on requests that require it. Failure to do so on endpoints that require authentication will return a `401 Unauthorized`.

Some endpoints show information that a given system may have set to private. If this is a specific field
(eg. description), the field will simply contain `null` rather than the true value. If this applies to entire endpoint
responses (eg. fronter, switches, member list), the entire request will return `403 Forbidden`. Authenticating with the
system's token (as described above) will override these privacy settings and show the full information. 

## Rate Limiting

By default, there is a per-IP limit of 2 requests per second across the API. If you exceed this limit, you will get a 429 response code and will have to try again later.

The following rate limit headers are present on HTTP responses:

|name|description|
|---|---|
|X-RateLimit-Limit|The amount of total requests you have available per second.|
|X-RateLimit-Remaining|The amount of requests you have remaining until the next reset time.|
|X-RateLimit-Reset|The UNIX time (in milliseconds) when the ratelimit info will reset.|

If you make more requests than you have available, the server will respond with a 429 status code and a JSON error body.

```json
{
  "message": "429: too many requests",
  "retry_after": 19, // the amount of milliseconds remaining until you can make more requests
  "code": 0
}
```

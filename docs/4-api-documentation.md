# API documentation
PluralKit has a basic HTTP REST API for querying and modifying your system.
The root endpoint of the API is `https://api.pluralkit.me/v1/`.

Endpoints will always return all fields, using `null` when a value is missing. On `PATCH` endpoints,
missing fields from the JSON request will be ignored and preserved as is, but on `POST` endpoints will
be set to `null` or cleared.

Endpoints taking JSON bodies (eg. most `PATCH` and `PUT` endpoints) require the `Content-Type: application/json` header set.

## Authentication
Authentication is done with a simple "system token". You can get your system token by running `pk;token` using the
Discord bot, either in a channel with the bot or in DMs. Then, pass this token in the `Authorization` HTTP header
on requests that require it. Failure to do so on endpoints that require authentication will return a `401 Unauthorized`.

Some endpoints show information that a given system may have set to private. If this is a specific field
(eg. description), the field will simply contain `null` rather than the true value. If this applies to entire endpoint
responses (eg. fronter, switches, member list), the entire request will return `403 Forbidden`. Authenticating with the
system's token (as described above) will override these privacy settings and show the full information. 

## Models
The following three models (usually represented in JSON format) represent the various objects in PluralKit's API. A `?` after the column type indicates an optional (nullable) parameter.

### System model

|---|---|---|---|
|id|string|No||
|name|string?|Yes|100-character limit.|
|description|string?|Yes|1000-character limit.|
|tag|string?|Yes||
|avatar_url|url?|Yes|Not validated server-side.|
|tz|string?|Yes|Tzdb identifier. Patching with `null` will store `"UTC"`.|

## Endpoints

### GET /s
**Requires authentication.**

Returns information about your own system.

#### Example request
    GET https://api.pluralkit.me/v1/s

#### Example response
```json
{
    "id": "abcde",
    "name": "My System",
    "description": "This is my system description. Yay.",
    "tag": "[MySys]",
    "avatar_url": "https://path/to/avatar/image.png",
    "tz": "Europe/Copenhagen",
    "created": "2019-01-01T14:30:00.987654Z"
}
```

### GET /s/\<id>
Queries a system by its 5-character ID, and returns information about it. If the system doesn't exist, returns `404 Not Found`.
Some fields may be set to `null` if unauthenticated and the system has chosen to make those fields private.

#### Example request
    GET https://api.pluralkit.me/v1/s/abcde

#### Example response
```json
{
    "id": "abcde",
    "name": "My System",
    "description": "This is my system description. Yay.",
    "tag": "[MySys]",
    "avatar_url": "https://path/to/avatar/image.png",
    "tz": "Europe/Copenhagen",
    "created": "2019-01-01T14:30:00.987654Z"
}
```

### GET /s/\<id>/members
Queries a system's member list by its 5-character ID. If the system doesn't exist, returns `404 Not Found`.
If the system has chosen to hide its member list, this will return `403 Forbidden`, unless the request is authenticated with the system's token.
If the request is not authenticated with the system's token, members marked as private will *not* be returned.

#### Example request
    GET https://api.pluralkit.me/v1/s/abcde/members

#### Example response
```json
[
    {
        "id": "qwert",
        "name": "Craig Johnson",
        "color": "ff7000",
        "avatar_url": "https://path/to/avatar/image.png",
        "birthday": "1997-07-14",
        "pronouns": "he/him or they/them",
        "description": "I am Craig, example user extraordinaire.",
        "proxy_tags": [{"prefix": "[", "suffix": "]"}],
        "keep_proxy": false,
        "created": "2019-01-01T15:00:00.654321Z"
    }
]
```

### GET /s/\<id>/switches[?before=<timestamp>]
Returns a system's switch history in newest-first chronological order, with a maximum of 100 switches. If the system doesn't exist, returns `404 Not Found`.
Optionally takes a `?before=` query parameter with an ISO-8601-formatted timestamp, and will only return switches
that happen before that timestamp.

If the system has chosen to hide its switch history, this will return `403 Forbidden`, unless the request is authenticated with the system's token.

#### Example request
    GET https://api.pluralkit.me/v1/s/abcde/switches?before=2019-03-01T14:00:00Z

#### Example response
```json
[
    {
        "timestamp": "2019-02-23T14:20:59.123456Z",
        "members": ["qwert", "yuiop"]
    },
    {
        "timestamp": "2019-02-22T12:00:00Z",
        "members": ["yuiop"]
    },
    {
        "timestamp": "2019-02-20T09:30:00Z",
        "members": []
    }
]
```

### GET /s/\<id>/fronters
Returns a system's current fronter(s), with fully hydrated member objects. If the system doesn't exist, *or* the system has no registered switches, returns `404 Not Found`.
If the system has chosen to hide its current fronters, this will return `403 Forbidden`, unless the request is authenticated with the system's token. If a returned member is private, and the request isn't properly authenticated, some fields may be null.

#### Example request
    GET https://api.pluralkit.me/v1/s/abcde/fronters

#### Example response
```json
{
    "timestamp": "2019-07-09T17:22:46.47441Z",
    "members": [
        {
            "id": "qwert",
            "name": "Craig Johnson",
            "color": "ff7000",

            "pronouns": "he/him or they/them",
            "description": "I am Craig, example user extraordinaire.",
            "proxy_tags": [{"prefix": "[", "suffix": "]"}],
            "keep_proxy": false,
            "created": "2019-01-01T15:00:00.654321Z"
        }
    ]
}
```

#### Example response
(`204 No Content`)

### GET /a/\<id>
Queries a system by its linked Discord account ID (17/18-digit numeric snowflake). Returns `404 Not Found` if the account doesn't have a system linked.
Some fields may be set to `null` if unauthenticated and the system has chosen to make those fields private.

#### Example request
    GET https://api.pluralkit.me/v1/a/466378653216014359

#### Example response
```json
{
    "id": "abcde",

    "description": "This is my system description. Yay.",
    "tag": "[MySys]",
    "avatar_url": "https://path/to/avatar/image.png",
    "tz": "Europe/Copenhagen",
    "created": "2019-01-01T14:30:00.987654Z"
}
```

### GET /msg/\<id>
Looks up a proxied message by its message ID. Returns `404 Not Found` if the message ID is invalid or wasn't found (eg. was deleted or not proxied by PK).
You can also look messages up by their *trigger* message ID (useful for, say, logging bot integration).

The returned system and member's privacy settings will be respected, and as such, some fields may be set to null without the proper authentication.

#### Example request
    GET https://api.pluralkit.me/v1/msg/601014599386398700

#### Example response
```json

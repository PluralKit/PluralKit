It allows you to register systems, maintain system information, set up message proxying, log switches, and more.\n\n**Who's this for? What are systems?**\nPut simply, a system is a person that shares their body with at least 1 other sentient \"self\". This may be a result of having a dissociative disorder like DID/OSDD or a practice known as Tulpamancy, but people that aren't tulpamancers or undiagnosed and have headmates are also systems.\n\n**Why are people's names saying [BOT] next to them? What's going on?**\nThese people are not actually bots, this is simply a caveat to the message proxying feature of PluralKit.\nType `pk;help proxy` for an in-depth explanation."

Imagine you're proxying the word \"text\", and add that to the end of the command. For example: `pk;member John proxy [text]`. That will set the member John up to use square brackets as proxy tags. Now saying something like `[hello world]` will proxy the text \"hello world\" with John's name and avatar. You can also use other symbols, letters, numbers, et cetera, as prefixes, suffixes, or both. `J:text`, `$text` and `text]` are also examples of valid example matches."

It allows you to register systems, maintain system information, set up message proxying, log switches, and more.\n\n**What's this for? What are systems?**\nThis bot detects messages with certain tags associated with a profile, then replaces that message under a \"pseudo-account\" of that profile using webhooks. This is useful for multiple people sharing one body (aka \"systems\"), people who wish to roleplay as different characters without having several accounts, or anyone else who may want to post messages as a different person from the same account.\n\n**Why are people's names saying [BOT] next to them?**\nThese people are not actually bots, this is just a Discord limitation.\nType `pk;help proxy` for an in-depth explanation."

Imagine you're proxying the word \"text\", and add that to the end of the command. For example: `pk;member John proxy [text]`. That will set the member John up to use square brackets as proxy tags. Now saying something like `[hello world]` will proxy the text \"hello world\" with John's name and avatar. You can also use other symbols, letters, numbers, et cetera, as prefixes, suffixes, or both. `J:text`, `$text` and `text]` are also examples of valid example matches."

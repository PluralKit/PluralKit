**Proxying**
Proxying through PluralKit lets system members have their own faux-account with their name and avatar.
You'll type a message from your account in *proxy tags*, and PluralKit will recognize those tags and repost the message with the proper details.

To set up a member's proxy tag, use the `pk;member <name> proxy [example match]` command.

You'll need to give the bot an "example match". Imagine you're proxying the word "text", and add that to the end.
For example: `pk;member John proxy [text]`. That will set the member John up to use square brackets as proxy tags.
Now saying something like `[hello world]` will proxy the text "hello world" with John's name and avatar.
You can also use other symbols, letters, numbers, et cetera, as prefixes, suffixes, or both. `J:text`, `$text` and `text]` are also examples of valid example matches.

**Notes**
You can delete a proxied message by reacting to it with the :x: emoji from the sender's account.

PluralKit is a bot designed for plural communities on Discord. It allows you to register systems, maintain system information, set up message proxying, log switches, and more.

**Getting started**
To get started using the bot, try running the following commands.
**1**. `pk;system new` - Create a system if you haven't already
**2**. `pk;member add John` - Add a new member to your system
**3**. `pk;member John proxy [text]` - Set up square brackets as proxy tags
**4**. You're done!

**More information**
For a full list of commands, type `pk;help commands`.
For a more in-depth explanation of proxying, type `pk;help proxy`.
If you're an existing user of the Tupperware proxy bot, type `pk;import` to import your data from there.

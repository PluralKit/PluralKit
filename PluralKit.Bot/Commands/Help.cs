You're done! You can now type [a message in brackets] and it'll be proxied appropriately.\n**5**. Optionally, you may set an avatar from the URL of an image with `pk;member John avatar [link to image]`, or from a file by typing `pk;member John avatar` and sending the message with an attached image.\n\nSee [the Getting Started guide](https://pluralkit.me/start) for more information."))
